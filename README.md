# operation manual

## First, ensure the directory f:/out1229/ exists
## And download the data to drive F:
## Steps for Figure 5(a):
Comment out the lines between line 625 and line 740 (in the main function)
Change #define NPoint 70 (line 19) from 70 to 10, 40, 70, 100 successively, and run the program
Record the size of the output file (in folder f:/out1229/) each time

## Steps for Figure 5(b):
Change char file_in[30] = "f:/in/100/in_" (line 533) from 100 to 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 successively, and run the program
Record the size of the output file (in folder f:/out1229/) each time

## The process for Figure 6 is the same as Figure 5, just need to record the execution time instead
## Steps for Figure 7:
Simply run the code, the last 40 outputs are the data for Figure 7
